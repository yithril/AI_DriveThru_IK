  - Track cache hit rates and performance impact
- **Benefits:**
  - Verify caching is working as expected
  - Identify performance bottlenecks
  - Optimize cache strategy if needed

### **Auto-Clear Order After Completion**
- **Description:** Automatically clear order and return to ready state after order completion
- **Current Issue:** Orders persist after completion, requiring manual "Next Customer" click
- **Implementation:**
  - Detect when order is completed (customer says "that's it" or similar)
  - Add timer (e.g., 5-10 seconds) after completion
  - Auto-trigger "Next Customer" functionality
  - Show "Ready for next customer" state
- **Benefits:**
  - Smoother drive-thru flow
